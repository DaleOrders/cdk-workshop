# Deploying a Simple Static Website on AWS using S3 and Cloudfront

This workshop sdemonstrates how to create and deploy a simple static website using AWS CDK with TypeScript. The project will cover:

- Initializing a basic AWS CDK project structure.
- Defining infrastructure as code (IaC) with TypeScript.
- Creating AWS resources necessary for hosting a static website using S3 and Cloudfront.
- Deploying the website to AWS.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (>= 14.x)
- **AWS CLI** (configures upon authorization)
- **AWS CDK** (>= 2.x)

To install AWS CDK globally:

```bash
npm install -g aws-cdk
```

---

## Step 1: Initialize the Project

1. **Create a project directory** and navigate to it:

```bash
mkdir cdk-workshop && cd cdk-workshop
   ```

2. **Initialize a new CDK app**:

```bash
cdk init app --language typescript
   ```

3. Update aws-cdk-lib to the latest version:


```bash
npm install aws-cdk-lib@latest
   ```

4. Install dependencies for the CDK constructs we'll use:

```bash
npm install constructs@latest
   ```

CDK Dependencies as shown in the package.json file

## Step 2: Create a Simple Website

1. **Download the website template from [html5up.net](https://html5up.net/dimension/download)**:

2. unzip the file, navigate to the folder and either manually copy all the files to a new folder called 'website' in your project or run the following command.

```bash
cp -r ~/Downloads/html5up-dimension $(pwd)/website/
```

## Step 3: Write CDK Code to Host the Website

**Architecture**:

![alt text](image-6.png)

1. **Configure the region as ap-southeast-2**:

Edit the `bin/cdk-workshop.ts` to explicity set the aws region to be ap-southeast-2:

Your CDK stack name must be unqiue so update the name of the stack to your name (or something else unique). 

In the example below I have used 'DaleCDKStack'

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env node
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { S3StaticWebsiteStack } from '../lib/cdk-workshop-stack';

const app = new cdk.App();
new S3StaticWebsiteStack (app, 'DaleCDKStack', {
env: { region: 'ap-southeast-2' },
});
```

Note that the app imports the `S3StaticWebsiteStack` stack from `lib/cdk-s3-website-stack.ts`

2. **Configure the `S3StaticWebsiteStack` stack**:

Edit the `lib/cdk-s3-website-stack.ts` file to define the an S3 bucket and deploy the website under './website' folder:

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { Bucket, BlockPublicAccess } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3';
import { BucketDeployment, Source } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3-deployment';
import { Distribution, ViewerProtocolPolicy } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudfront';
import { S3Origin } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudfront-origins';

export class S3StaticWebsiteStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Create an S3 bucket for the static website
    const websiteBucket = new Bucket(this, 'StaticWebsiteBucket', {
      websiteIndexDocument: 'index.html',
      removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY, // Only for dev environments, not recommended for prod
      autoDeleteObjects: true, // Automatically deletes objects when the bucket is destroyed (for dev environments)
      blockPublicAccess: BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ACLS, // Block ACL-based public access
      publicReadAccess: true
    });

    // Deploy local files to the S3 bucket
    new BucketDeployment(this, 'DeployWebsite', {
      sources: [Source.asset('./website')], // Path to your local website files
      destinationBucket: websiteBucket,
    });


    // Output the website URL
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'WebsiteURL', {
      value: websiteBucket.bucketWebsiteUrl,
      description: 'The website URL',});
      
  }
}
```

---

## Step 4: Generate AWS user credientials

Architecture

![alt text](image-8.png)

To generate temporary user credientials, input the token and run the following command

```bash
curl -X GET https://bzhogu7hpj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Dev/assumeRole -H "Authorization: <<token>>"
   ```

Paste the credientials into your terminal and press enter

---

## Step 5: Deploy the Website

Run the following commands to deploy your website:

1. **Bootstrap the environment**:

```bash
cdk bootstrap
   ```

2. **Synthethize the cloudtemplate template**:

```bash
cdk synth
   ```

Go to the manifest file `cdk.out/CdkWorkshopStack.template.json` to see the cloudformation template that has been generated from the `S3StaticWebsiteStack` stack.

3. **Deploy the CDK application**:

```bash
cdk deploy
   ```

You will be asked 'Do you wish to deploy these changes (y/n)?' Type y

![alt text](image-4.png)

During deployment, the CDK will output the URL for the hosted website. You can access your site using this URL.

---

## Step 6: Update the S3 website to use Cloudfront and re-deploy

1. **Architecture**:

![alt text](image-7.png)

1. **Update the `lib/cdk-s3-website-stack.ts` file to include CloudFront**:

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { Bucket, BlockPublicAccess } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3';
import { BucketDeployment, Source } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3-deployment';
import { Distribution, ViewerProtocolPolicy } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudfront';
import { S3Origin } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudfront-origins';

export class S3StaticWebsiteStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Create an S3 bucket for the static website
    const websiteBucket = new Bucket(this, 'StaticWebsiteBucket', {
      removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY, // Only for dev environments, not recommended for prod
      autoDeleteObjects: true, // Automatically deletes objects when the bucket is destroyed (for dev environments)
      blockPublicAccess: BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ACLS, // Block ACL-based public access
    });

    // Deploy local files to the S3 bucket
    new BucketDeployment(this, 'DeployWebsite', {
      sources: [Source.asset('./website')], // Path to your local website files
      destinationBucket: websiteBucket,
    });

    // Create CloudFront distribution to serve content over HTTPS
    const distribution = new Distribution(this, 'CloudFrontDistribution', {
      defaultBehavior: {
        origin: new S3Origin(websiteBucket),
        viewerProtocolPolicy: ViewerProtocolPolicy.REDIRECT_TO_HTTPS, // Enforce HTTPS
      },
      defaultRootObject: 'index.html', // Default page for the website
    });

    // Output the CloudFront URL (which will be HTTPS by default)
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'CloudFrontURL', {
      value: `https://${distribution.domainName}`,
      description: 'The CloudFront distribution URL',
    });
  }
}

```

2. **Run cdk diff to compare differences**:

cdk diff will show differences between your deployed stack and the new changes

   ```bash
   cdk diff
   ```

3. **Deploy the stack**:


```bash
cdk deploy
   ```
This will generate a HTTPS url for your stack website using cloudfront. Note HTTP access is disabled

---

## Step 7: Extend your application (optional)

Now you know how to create and deploy a stack, try to do one of the following:
* Use the AWS construct hub below to change some of the properities of the constructs you have in your stack
* See if you can deploy multiples copies of your stack to the same region
* See if you can deploy your stack to a different region
* See if you can create a new stack with a bucket resource and deploy it

Reference: [AWS Construct Hub](https://constructs.dev/)


## Clean Up

To avoid incurring unnecessary charges, delete the stack. 

1. **Destroy the stack**:


   ```bash
   cdk destroy
   ```

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated how to use AWS CDK with TypeScript to deploy a simple static website on AWS using S3 and Cloudfront. The focus was on showcasing the CDKâ€™s capabilities for infrastructure provisioning and deployment automation. You can now customize and expand upon this setup for more complex use cases.
